## Developing

Dependencies are managed in `package.json` and installed with `npm install`

To build the mapbox.js distributions, first create a new version of mapbox.js and make a new git tag. Then call

    ./build.sh v0.5.0

Or the tag you desire. This will build files in `dist/v0.5.0`

## The Site

The site is autogenerated - a combination of `API.md` and `STYLE.md` files in each subproject, and YAML files in `site/`. To generate the site, run

    ./build-site.sh v0.5.0

And `git add` the new posts in `_posts`
