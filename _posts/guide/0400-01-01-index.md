mapbox.js is the MapBox Javascript API: an open-source toolkit that makes
building web maps faster, simpler, and more repeatable.
With it, you can make anything
from a [one-line drop-in map](/mapbox.js/example/auto/) to animated,
connected, integrated map code.

The Javascript API is a part of our open platform - just one way to publish
your MapBox maps. Wondering all works? [Read about the fundamentals of
web maps for a better idea of the system](/developers/guide/).

While you can download the open-source, freely licensed
[code on GitHub](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox.js) and host it locally -
or even offline, it's also provided hosted for free on MapBox's
[lightning fast infrastructure](http://mapbox.com/blog/building-mapbox-fast-map-hosting-stack/)
to quickly include in your own webpages.

To use the Javascript API, you'll need to know elementary Javascript concepts.
If you'd like to learn, luckily there's plenty of free reading -
[Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html) as a guide,
[codecademy for interactive lessons](http://www.codecademy.com), as well as
[Mozilla's excellent reference material](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript/).

If you know [CSS](http://www.cssbasics.com), you can also use your design
skills to customize every part of the map's presentation, so that controls
like zoom buttons perfectly fit your [custom MapBox Streets](http://mapbox.com/maps/)
and [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) layers.

For a complete reference of all the functionality that the Javascript API
provides, [consult the API documentation](/mapbox.js/api/).
