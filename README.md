# mapbox.js examples

### Ground rules:

* The structure of an example is `_posts/examplename/0100-01-01-examplename.html`.
* All files necessary for examples must be in their own directory.
* Examples use hosted mapbox.js, with the latest deployed version.

### Updating the site to the latest deployed version of mapbox.js:

* The version tag is updated in the yaml front matter of the `_layouts/example.html` file.
* Each example should be tested against the version change.
